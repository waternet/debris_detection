# debris_detection
Python code for debris detection using logistic regression on pictures

# What is it?
This is the first code to try and create a machine learning model that is able to recognize floating debris from normal water. The current code scores 97% accurate but of course this al depends on the amount of pictures and the quality of the labels.
